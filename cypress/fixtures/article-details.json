                "JavaScript is a language that allows programs to run in different environments. In our case, we are talking about browsers and the Node.js server platform. If you haven't written a single line of JS code yet and are reading this text in a browser on a desktop computer, this means that you are literally seconds away from your first JavaScript program.",
                "There are other ways to run JS code in the browser. So, in the typical usage of JavaScript programs, they are loaded into the browser to make web pages work. As a rule, the code is formatted as separate files with the .js extension, which are connected to web pages, but the program code can also be included directly in the page code. All this is done using the <script> tag. When the browser encounters such code, it executes it. For more information about the script tag, visit w3school.com. In particular, let's consider an example demonstrating how to work with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource. This example can also be run using this resource (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we will do it a little differently. Namely, let's create a new file in some text editor (for example, in VS Code or Notepad++), which we will call hello.html, and add the following code to it:"
            ]
        }
